Taylor rates: Tim's orginal used (January 01, 2019 to March 31, 2024), updated version up to December 31, 2024  exists, partially based on preliminary data though

Compare Tatar and Wieland (2025) vs Tim:
- both use Taylor (1993) rule with response coefficients on both inflation and output gaps of 0.5 (for inflation gap 1.5 in total)
- frequency: Tatar and Wieland (2025): quarterly data; Tim: monthly data
- natural rate of interest:  Tatar and Wieland (2025): -1.5% and 0.5%; Tim: 0% and 2% (cf. ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 1/2025: more recent estimates lie between -0.5% and 1%)
- output gap: Tatar and Wieland (2025): for EU, deviation of the log GDP log of potential GDP, European Commission’s estimate of potential GDP used; Tim: for Germany,  quarterly real German GDP from DESTATIS and yearly potential output from AMECO interpolated to quarterly data
- output gap: note that Tatar and Wieland (2025) use model-based adjusted output gaps of one-eighth of the original gaps in the period from  Q1 2020 to Q3 2021 to capture the supply-side effects of the 
pandemic, see Tatar and Wieland (2024)
- inflation gap: Tatar and Wieland (2025):  EU's HICP core (Eurostat), Tim: German CPI (Statistisches Bundesamt, both as deviations from ECB's target of 2%


Alternative to Taylor (1993) rule: Orphanides and Wieland (2013) rule:  change of the interest rate depends on near-term forecasts of inflation relative to the target and output growth relative to the European 
Commission’s estimate of potential growth, GIVE FORMULA
- fits past ECB decisions fairly well
- first-difference rule
- does not depend on the choice of natural rate of interest
- does not depend on the estimate of the level of potential GDP
